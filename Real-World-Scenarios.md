# Real-World Event Processing Scenarios

## Scenario Matrix: Production Issues vs Solutions

| Issue Type | Current Behavior | Improved Solution | Business Impact |
|------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Handler Timeout** | Event marked as failed, no retry | Auto-retry with exponential backoff | 99% success rate |
| **Database Connection Lost** | All events fail permanently | Retry until connection restored | Zero data loss |
| **Email Service Down** | Email events lost | Queue in DLQ, retry when service up | No missed notifications |
| **High Load Spike** | Events process sequentially, queue builds up | Concurrent processing scales automatically | Maintains SLA |
| **Duplicate Events** | Same event processed multiple times | Idempotency check prevents duplicates | Data consistency |

## Detailed Scenario Flows

### 1. Chemical Status Update Cascade (High Volume)
**Trigger**: Chemical regulation change affects 1000+ chemicals

```
User updates regulation → 1000 ChemicalStatus events → Concurrent processing
├── 950 events succeed immediately
├── 30 events fail (DB lock timeout)
│   └── Retry after 1s → 28 succeed, 2 retry again
│       └── Retry after 2s → All succeed
└── 20 events timeout (external API slow)
    └── Retry after exponential backoff → All succeed
```

**Result**: 100% success, 99.9% within 5 minutes

### 2. Email Service Outage Recovery
**Trigger**: SMTP server maintenance window

```
Email events arrive → Handler connects to SMTP → Connection refused
├── Attempt 1: Immediate failure → Record attempt
├── Attempt 2: Retry after 1s → Still failing → Record attempt  
├── Attempt 3: Retry after 2s → Still failing → Send to DLQ
└── DLQ Monitor: Retry every 5 minutes during maintenance
    └── Service restored → Process DLQ → All emails sent
```

**Result**: Zero lost emails, delayed but delivered

### 3. Database Connection Pool Exhaustion
**Trigger**: Heavy reporting load exhausts DB connections

```
Multiple events arrive simultaneously → All try to save EventRecord
├── First 10 events: Get connections, succeed
├── Next 20 events: Connection pool exhausted, fail
│   └── Retry with exponential backoff spreads the load
│       └── Connections released, retries succeed
└── Monitoring alerts DBA about pool size
```

**Result**: Automatic recovery, no manual intervention

### 4. Malformed Event Data
**Trigger**: Client sends invalid JSON payload

```
Invalid event arrives → JSON deserialization fails
├── Validation layer catches error
├── Event marked as INVALID (no retry)
├── Error logged with full payload
└── Alert sent to development team
```

**Result**: System stability maintained, dev team notified

### 5. Cross-System Dependency Failure
**Trigger**: External API (chemical database) returns 500 errors

```
Chemical lookup event → External API call fails
├── Circuit breaker detects failures
├── Retry with exponential backoff
├── After 3 retries → Send to DLQ
└── Admin dashboard shows dependency health
    └── Manual review required for business-critical events
```

**Result**: System resilience, graceful degradation

## Production Metrics Dashboard

### Success Rate Tracking
```
Chemical Events: 99.8% success (2 DLQ out of 1000)
Email Events: 97.5% success (25 DLQ during maintenance)
Report Events: 99.9% success (1 DLQ - data corruption)
```

### Processing Time Distribution  
```
P50: 150ms (median processing time)
P90: 800ms (90% processed within this time)
P99: 2.1s (99% processed within this time)
Max: 5.2s (slowest event, still within SLA)
```

### Retry Analysis
```
First Attempt Success: 95%
Second Attempt Success: 4.5%
Third Attempt Success: 0.4%
Sent to DLQ: 0.1%
```

## Operational Runbooks

### DLQ Processing Runbook
1. **Check DLQ Dashboard**: Identify event types in DLQ
2. **Analyze Root Cause**: Check error messages and timestamps
3. **Fix Underlying Issue**: Restart service, fix configuration, etc.
4. **Replay DLQ Events**: Use admin API to reprocess
5. **Monitor Success Rate**: Ensure replayed events succeed

### High Retry Rate Alert
1. **Immediate Check**: Verify system health (DB, external APIs)
2. **Scale Resources**: Increase thread pool if CPU/memory allows
3. **Check Dependencies**: Verify external service health
4. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders of potential delays
5. **Root Cause Analysis**: Post-incident review

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR-001: Exponential Backoff Strategy
**Decision**: Use 2^attempt * 1000ms with jitter
**Rationale**: Prevents thundering herd, allows transient issues to resolve
**Trade-offs**: Slight delay vs system stability

### ADR-002: Thread Pool Sizing  
**Decision**: 10 concurrent consumers per listener
**Rationale**: Balance throughput vs resource usage
**Trade-offs**: May need tuning based on handler complexity

### ADR-003: DLQ Retention Policy
**Decision**: Keep DLQ events for 30 days
**Rationale**: Sufficient time for manual review and reprocessing
**Trade-offs**: Storage cost vs operational flexibility

## Monitoring & Alerting Strategy

### Critical Alerts (P0 - Immediate Response)
- DLQ count > 100 events
- Success rate < 95% for 5 minutes
- No events processed in 10 minutes

### Warning Alerts (P1 - Next Business Day)
- Retry rate > 10% for 1 hour  
- Average processing time > 2 seconds
- Database connection pool > 80%

### Info Alerts (P2 - Weekly Review)
- New error types appeared
- Processing volume unusual patterns
- Performance degradation trends

This architecture ensures robust, scalable, and maintainable event processing for the Q-Chem system while addressing all three critical issues identified.
